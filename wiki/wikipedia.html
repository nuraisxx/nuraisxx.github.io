             <p>Consciousness, at its simplest, is awareness of internal and external existence.
                 However, its nature has led to millennia of analyses, explanations and debates by philosophers, theologians, linguists, and scientists. Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied or even considered consciousness. In some explanations, it is synonymous with the mind, and at other times, an aspect of mind. In the past, it was one's "inner life", the world of introspection, of private thought, imagination and volition.
                  Today, it often includes any kind of cognition,experience, feeling or perception. 
                 It may be awareness, awareness of awareness, or self-awareness either continuously changing or not.

             <h2>Etymology</h2>
             <div>
                <p>In the late 20th century, philosophers like Hamlyn, Rorty, and Wilkes have disagreed with Kahn, Hardie and Modrak as to whether Aristotle even had a concept of consciousness.
                     Aristotle does not use any single word or terminology to name the phenomenon; it is used only much later, especially by John Locke. 
                    Caston contends that for Aristotle, perceptual awareness was somewhat the same as what modern philosophers call consciousness.
                    The origin of the modern concept of consciousness is often attributed to Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding, published in 1690.
                     Locke defined consciousness as "the perception of what passes in a man's own mind".
                      His essay influenced the 18th-century view of consciousness, and his definition appeared in Samuel Johnson's celebrated Dictionary (1755).
                       "Consciousness" (French: conscience) is also defined in the 1753 volume of Diderot and d'Alembert's Encyclopédie, as "the opinion or internal feeling that we ourselves have from what we do".A related word was conscientia, which primarily means moral conscience. 
                       In the literal sense, "conscientia" means knowledge-with, that is, shared knowledge. The word first appears in Latin juridical texts by writers such as Cicero.[14] Here, conscientia is the knowledge that a witness has of the deed of someone else.
                        René Descartes (1596–1650) is generally taken to be the first philosopher to use conscientia in a way that does not fit this traditional meaning.
                        Descartes used conscientia the way modern speakers would use "conscience". In Search after Truth (Regulæ ad directionem ingenii ut et inquisitio veritatis per lumen naturale, Amsterdam 1701) he says "conscience or internal testimony" (conscientiâ, vel interno testimonio).
            <h2>The problem of definition</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The dictionary definitions of the word consciousness extend through several centuries and reflect a range of seemingly related meanings, with some differences that have been controversial, such as the distinction between 'inward awareness' and 'perception' of the physical world, or the distinction between 'conscious' and 'unconscious', or the notion of a "mental entity" or "mental activity" that is not physical.
                    The common usage definitions of consciousness in Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1966 edition, Volume 1, page 482) are as follows:

                    awareness or perception of an inward psychological or spiritual fact; intuitively perceived knowledge of something in one's inner self
                    inward awareness of an external object, state, or fact
                    concerned awareness; INTEREST, CONCERN—often used with an attributive noun [e.g. class consciousness]
                    the state or activity that is characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, or thought; mind in the broadest possible sense; something in nature that is distinguished from the physical
                    the totality in psychology of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes, and feelings of which an individual or a group is aware at any given time or within a particular time span—compare STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS
                    waking life (as that to which one returns after sleep, trance, fever) wherein all one's mental powers have returned . . .
                    the part of mental life or psychic content in psychoanalysis that is immediately available to the ego—compare PRECONSCIOUS, UNCONSCIOUS
            <h2>Coherence of the concept</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Philosophers differ from non-philosophers in their intuitions about what consciousness is.
                     While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions. 
                     Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world.
                      He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. 
                     Thus, by speaking of "consciousness" we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings.
            <h2>Neural correlates</h2>         
            <div>
                <p>A major part of the scientific literature on consciousness consists of studies that examine the relationship between the experiences reported by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their brains—that is, studies of the neural correlates of consciousness. 
                    The hope is to find that activity in a particular part of the brain, or a particular pattern of global brain activity, which will be strongly predictive of conscious awareness.
                     Several brain imaging techniques, such as EEG and fMRI, have been used for physical measures of brain activity in these studies.
              <h2>Altered states</h2>       
              <div>
                <p>
                    There are some brain states in which consciousness seems to be absent, including dreamless sleep or coma. 
                    There are also a variety of circumstances that can change the relationship between the mind and the world in less drastic ways, producing what are known as altered states of consciousness.
                     Some altered states occur naturally; others can be produced by drugs or brain damage.
                     Altered states can be accompanied by changes in thinking, disturbances in the sense of time, feelings of loss of control, changes in emotional expression, alternations in body image and changes in meaning or significance.
               <h2>Distinguishing consciousness from its contents</h2>     
               <div>
                 <p><Sam Harris observes: "At the level of your experience, you are not a body of cells, organelles, and atoms; you are consciousness and its ever-changing contents".
                     Seen in this way, consciousness is a subjectively experienced, ever-present field in which things (the contents of consciousness) come and go.

                    Christopher Tricker argues that this field of consciousness is symbolized by the mythical bird that opens the Daoist classic the Zhuangzi.
                     This bird’s name is Of a Flock (peng 鵬), yet its back is countless thousands of miles across and its wings are like clouds arcing across the heavens.
                      "Like Of a Flock, whose wings arc across the heavens, the wings of your consciousness span to the horizon. 
                      At the same time, the wings of every other being’s consciousness span to the horizon. You are of a flock, one bird among kin."
             <h2>In artificial intelligence</h2>         
             <div> 
                <p>The idea of an artifact made conscious is an ancient theme of mythology, appearing for example in the Greek myth of Pygmalion, who carved a statue that was magically brought to life, and in medieval Jewish stories of the Golem, a magically animated homunculus built of clay.
                     However, the possibility of actually constructing a conscious machine was probably first discussed by Ada Lovelace, in a set of notes written in 1842 about the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage, a precursor (never built) to modern electronic computers.
                      Lovelace was essentially dismissive of the idea that a machine such as the Analytical Engine could think in a humanlike way.
                       She wrote:

                    It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. ... 
                    The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. 
                    It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. 
                    It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. 
                    Its province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted with.

                <h2>Types</h2>    
                <div>
                    <p>Ned Block argued that discussions on consciousness often failed to properly distinguish phenomenal (P-consciousness) from access (A-consciousness), though these terms had been used before Block.
                         P-consciousness, according to Block, is raw experience: it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions and feelings with our bodies and responses at the center.
                          These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called qualia.
                           A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. 
                           So, when we perceive, information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we introspect, information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we remember, information about the past is access conscious, and so on.
                            Although some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have disputed the validity of this distinction, others have broadly accepted it.
                             David Chalmers has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging: he calls this the hard problem of consciousness.

                        Some philosophers believe that Block's two types of consciousness are not the end of the story.
                        William Lycan, for example, argued in his book Consciousness and Experience that at least eight clearly distinct types of consciousness can be identified (organism consciousness; control consciousness; consciousness of; state/event consciousness; reportability; introspective consciousness; subjective consciousness; self-consciousness)—and that even this list omits several more obscure forms.
                        
                        There is also debate over whether or not A-consciousness and P-consciousness always coexist or if they can exist separately.
                         Although P-consciousness without A-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some hypothetical examples of A without P.
                          Block, for instance, suggests the case of a "zombie" that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. 
                          However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding "I don't know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but I hope I have illustrated their conceptual possibility."

                  <h2>Neural correlates</h2>                  
                  <div>
                    <p>A major part of the scientific literature on consciousness consists of studies that examine the relationship between the experiences reported by subjects and the activity that simultaneously takes place in their brains—that is, studies of the neural correlates of consciousness. 
                        The hope is to find that activity in a particular part of the brain, or a particular pattern of global brain activity, which will be strongly predictive of conscious awareness.
                         Several brain imaging techniques, such as EEG and fMRI, have been used for physical measures of brain activity in these studies.

                        Another idea that has drawn attention for several decades is that consciousness is associated with high-frequency (gamma band) oscillations in brain activity. 
                        This idea arose from proposals in the 1980s, by Christof von der Malsburg and Wolf Singer, that gamma oscillations could solve the so-called binding problem, by linking information represented in different parts of the brain into a unified experience.
                         Rodolfo Llinás, for example, proposed that consciousness results from recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance where the specific thalamocortical systems (content) and the non-specific (centromedial thalamus) thalamocortical systems (context) interact in the gamma band frequency via synchronous oscillations.
                         A number of studies have shown that activity in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness: it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the primary visual cortex (V1) show clear electrical responses to a stimulus.[82] Higher brain areas are seen as more promising, especially the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as executive functions.
                         There is substantial evidence that a "top-down" flow of neural activity (i.e., activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas) is more predictive of conscious awareness than a "bottom-up" flow of activity.
                          The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area, however: studies by Nikos Logothetis and his colleagues have shown, for example, that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., bistable percepts during binocular rivalry).[85] Furthermore, top-down feedback from higher to lower visual brain areas may be weaker or absent in the peripheral visual field, as suggested by some experimental data and theoretical arguments;nevertheless humans can perceive visual inputs in the peripheral visual field arising from bottom-up V1 neural activities.
                           Meanwhile, bottom-up V1 activities for the central visual fields can be vetoed, and thus made invisible to perception, by the top-down feedback, when these bottom-up signals are inconsistent with the brain's internal model of the visual world.

Modulation of neural responses may correlate with phenomenal experiences. 
In contrast to the raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with an important aspect of consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić it has been shown that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony.
 An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas.
  This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.

In 2013, the perturbational complexity index (PCI) was proposed, a measure of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state,[90] making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states.

Assuming that not only humans but even some non-mammalian species are conscious, a number of evolutionary approaches to the problem of neural correlates of consciousness open up. For example, assuming that birds are conscious—a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birds—there are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal, currently competing, mammalian consciousness–brain theories. The rationale for such a comparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain. So how similar are they? What homologs can be identified? The general conclusion from the study by Butler, et al.,[91] is that some of the major theories for the mammalian brain [92][93][94] also appear to be valid for the avian brain. The structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous counterparts in avian brains. Thus the main portions of the theories of Crick and Koch,[92] Edelman and Tononi,[93] and Cotterill [94] seem to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious. Edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness (which is a trait shared by humans and non-human animals) and higher-order consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human language capacity.[93] Certain aspects of the three theories, however, seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian consciousness. For instance, the suggestion by Crick and Koch that layer 5 neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role, seems difficult to apply to the avian brain, since the avian homologs have a different morphology. Likewise, the theory of Eccles[95][96] seems incompatible, since a structural homolog/analogue to the dendron has not been found in avian brains. The assumption of an avian consciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus. The reason is the structural continuity between avian and reptilian brains, meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by many leading neuroscientists.

Joaquin Fuster of UCLA has advocated the position of the importance of the prefrontal cortex in humans, along with the areas of Wernicke and Broca, as being of particular importance to the development of human language capacities neuro-anatomically necessary for the emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans.

A study in 2016 looked at lesions in specific areas of the brainstem that were associated with coma and vegetative states.
 A small region of the rostral dorsolateral pontine tegmentum in the brainstem was suggested to drive consciousness through functional connectivity with two cortical regions, the left ventral anterior insular cortex, and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. 
 These three regions may work together as a triad to maintain consciousness.

Models
Further information: Models of consciousness
A wide range of empirical theories of consciousness have been proposed. Adrian Doerig and colleagues list 13 notable theories, while Anil Seth and Tim Bayne list 22 notable theories.

Global workspace theory (GWT) is a cognitive architecture and theory of consciousness proposed by the cognitive psychologist Bernard Baars in 1988.[102] Baars explains the theory with the metaphor of a theater, with conscious processes represented by an illuminated stage.[102] This theater integrates inputs from a variety of unconscious and otherwise autonomous networks in the brain and then broadcasts them to unconscious networks (represented in the metaphor by a broad, unlit "audience").[102] The theory has since been expanded upon by other scientists including cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene and Lionel Naccache.[103]

Integrated information theory (IIT) postulates that consciousness resides in the information being processed and arises once the information reaches a certain level of complexity.[104] Proponents of this model suggest that it may provide a physical grounding for consciousness in neurons, as they provide the mechanism by which information is integrated.[105]

Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) postulates that consciousness originates at the quantum level inside neurons.
The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules. 
However the details of the mechanism would go beyond current quantum theory.

In 2011, Graziano and Kastner[107] proposed the "attention schema" theory of awareness. In that theory, specific cortical areas, notably in the superior temporal sulcus and the temporo-parietal junction, are used to build the construct of awareness and attribute it to other people.
 The same cortical machinery is also used to attribute awareness to oneself. 
 Damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in consciousness such as hemispatial neglect. In the attention schema theory, the value of explaining the feature of awareness and attributing it to a person is to gain a useful predictive model of that person's attentional processing. Attention is a style of information processing in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated signals. 
 Awareness, in this theory, is a useful, simplified schema that represents attentional states. To be aware of X is explained by constructing a model of one's attentional focus on X.
