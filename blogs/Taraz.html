   <p>Taraz is an ancient city in the Kazakh Desert. Taraz is the capital of the Jambyl Region.</p>
   <h2 id="first"><strong>About Taraz:</strong></h2>
   <p>Taraz is an ancient city with history going back thousands of years, being one of the trade centers on the Silk
      Road.
      Now, most of the attractions to see in Taraz are old mausoleums, which admittedly were mostly rebuilt in 2002 by
      "Kazrestoration" experts. Still, if you want to follow the old Silk Road in Kazakhstan, Taraz is a city to stop
      by.</p>

   <h2 class="main-texts" id="fourth">Places To See:</h2>

   <p class="paragraph-3">
      <span class="see-text">Aisha-Bibi Mausoleum</span> <br>
      (Kazakh: Айша бибі кесенесі, Russian: Мавзолей Айша-биби) - this is the most famous attraction of
      Taraz, known throughout Kazakhstan. Dating to the 11th or 12th centuries, there are many different variations of
      legends
      behind this mausoleum. The most well-known story is she fell in love with Karakhan, but her father did not
      consent. Soon
      after she died from a snakebite, and Karakhan later had her mausoleum built. What sets this mausoleum apart from
      many
      others are its beautiful and intricate decorative patterns. Right beside Aisha's mausoleum is her caretaker's,
      Babadja-Khatun, who watched over Aisha's mausoleum until she died. Located 18km from Taraz, to have a taxi take
      you
      there and wait to take you back to Taraz should cost no more than 2,000 to 3,000 tenge (July 2017).
      <br>
      <span class="see-text">Zhambyl Zhabayev monument</span> <br>
      (Kazakh: Жамбыл Жабаевтың ескерткіші, Russian: Памятник Жамбылу Жабаеву) - in the middle of a
      roundabout is a statue of Zhambyl Zhabayev, a bard who was approved by Soviet powers. The statue was built in 1961
      and
      is included in the list of the monuments of history and culture of Kazakhstan of national importance. <br>
      <span class="see-text">Ancient Settlment of Taraz</span> <br>
      (Kazakh: Тараз қалашығы, Russian: Городище Тараз) - to the right of the Zhabayev monument is
      a park, and within the park is an excavation of an ancient Taraz settlement. It is dated from the 1st to 19th
      centuries
      AD. <br>
      <span class="see-text">The Mausoleum of Karakhan</span> <br>

      (Kazakh: Қарахан кесенесі, Russian: Мавзолей Карахана) - it was built in honour of the
      governor of Taraz from the dynasty of the Karakhanids, supposedly in the 11th century. According to legend, it was
      the
      governor who fell in love with Aisha-Bibi and ordered to build a mausoleum after her tragic death. It's said this
      mausoleum is facing the direction Aisha-Bibi's mauolseum is at. <br>
      <span class="see-text">Dautbek's Mausoleum</span> <br>

      (Kazakh: Дәуітбек Шамансұр кесенесі, Russian: Мавзолей Дауытбека Шамансура) - situated in the same
      area as Karakhan's mausoleum, this mausoleum was originally constructed in the 13th century over the grave of
      Dautbek, a
      Mongol governor. An Arabic inscription discovered at the mausoleum translates to, "The deceased owned a sword and
      pen.
      He was a defender of the Koran and the faithful". <br>

      <span class="see-text">The Kali Yunus Bath House</span> <br>
      (Kazakh: Қали Жүніс моншасы, Russian: Баня Кали-Жунуса) - exiting the Karakhan and Daubtek
      mausoleums and turning right, walk down the street and eventually you'll end up at this late 19th-century bath
      house.
      Merchan Yunus, nicknamed “Kali", was a rich citizen of the city of Taraz and traded with silk from Bukhara.
      According to
      his contemporaries, the wealth of Yunus was estimated in several chests of gems. When Kali heard that builders
      from
      Fergana and Bukhara came to the city, he invited them to build a public bath house for citizens of Taraz.
      Nametbai's Mosque (Kazakh: Нәметбай мешіті, Russian: Мечеть Наметбая) - exiting the Yunus Bath House and turning
      right,
      walk down the street until you arrive at this mosque, which is Taraz's oldest surviving mosque. 
      According to
      different
      sources, it was built in either 1867 or 1887 using funds given by a wealthy resident named Nametbai. Truthfully
      the
      mosque does not have splendid grandeur as more recently built ones, but it does have history. <br>

      <span class="see-text">Abdykadyr mosque</span> <br>
      (Kazakh: Әбдіқадыр мешіті, Russian: Мечеть Абдыкадыра) - another mosque built in the 19th century. It
      is located in the historic center of Taraz, Abay Street 5 (Абай көшесі, 5-құрылыс). <br>
      <span class="see-text">The Mausoleum of Tekturmas</span> <br>

      (Kazakh: Тектұрмас кесенесі, Russian: Мавзолей Тектурмас) - a mausoleum on a hill overlooking
      the Talas River, it's disputed whether it was originally constructed in the 14th or 16th centuries. The mausoleum
      is
      considered as the place of burial of someone named Sultan Makhmudkhan. According to one story, he was a local
      saint.
      According to another, he was a commander of the army of Karakhanid empire. The mausoleum was destroyed during the
      1930s,
      but thanks to a surviving photograph from the 1880s, it was reconstructed in 2002. <br>
      <span class="see-text">Akyrtas</span> <br>
      (Kazakh: Ақыртас, Russian: Акыртас) - although it is unsure what these ruins were, the general consensus now is
      they're ruins of an Arabian palace built during the 8th century AD. Large, red sandstones are what remain, as well
      as
      underground pipes which was evidence of plumbing. Near the palace ruins, there are also ruins of a small roadside
      caravanserai from the 8th century. To the south-west of the palace at a distance of 1km are ruins of a fortress
      with
      four towers and the castle of the ruler (dating from the 8th to 10th centuries). If you come here by taxi, do not
      let
      the driver rush you without seeing those other ruins. Akyrtas is 45km from Taraz and to come here by taxi should
      cost
      4000-5000 tenge roundtrip (July 2017).
